# X12.NET

This is an open source .NET C# implementation of an X12 Parser. Originally forked from [Inteligenz/X12Parser](https://github.com/Inteligenz/X12Parser).

The parser allows for a specification of any X12 transaction set to create a generic X12 xml representation of the hierarchical data contained within the X12 document.

While no SQL integration is required, there are interfaces to be able to interact with a SQL database. There are also integrations to parse the X12 to XML, HTML, and PDF documents.
